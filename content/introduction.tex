\section{introduction}
The aim of this course is to experiment embedded system design. For this purpose, we have to develop a vision-in-the loop solution. In this project, we have not only to implement the solution but aso to design it. There is different hardware materials available. We have to choose a part of them and mix them together in order to create our solution that we also have to define.

In this report, we will  talk about the global solution first before we describe each component of the system.
