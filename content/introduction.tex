\section{Introduction}
The aim of this course is to experiment with embedded system design. For this purpose, we have to develop a vision-in-the loop solution. In this project, we have not only to implement the solution, but also to design it, by analyzing and exploring the solution space. We have to choose between different hardware platforms and mix them together in order to design our solution that we also have to define. Choices have to be made with regards to the platforms and communication protocols used in the final solution.\\

As the final design, implementation of camera tracking a colored object was selected, in order to demonstrate possibilities of the available platforms. In this report, we will talk about the global solution first before we describe each component of the system, reasoning our choices.
